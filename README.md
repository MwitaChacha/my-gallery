# MY GALLERY

Welcome to the **My Gallery** python web application.

<hr>

## Description

**My Gallery** is a Python-based web application that allows users to view my favourite pictures that I, Jonathan Chacha, have taken over the years. This project is built to portray the skills that I have cultivated in Python/Django. Users can also get to interact with the various photos that I have submited; they are able to view detailed text related to a specific picture. This includes image descriptions, image locations, image categories and the image name.

## Setup Instructions

**My Gallery** is a web application which can be accessed by a device of choice with internet capabilities. No setup is required since it is in the form of a website. The application is built to be responsive across all devices with different media queries such as desktops, tablets and mobile phones.
